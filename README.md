## Project Spec

[Link to Turing School of Software Project Spec](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html)

## Instructions
- The purpose of this app is to help users to find a wine varietal that fits their current preferences and then find recipe pairings for that varietal
- The main page allows the user to immediately select a white or red varietal and be navigated to a page with information and recipes that pair with that varietal
- The user can also fill out a 8 question guide that will narrow down the varietals based on and while the questions are answered
- The selected varietal page has information about that varietal including similar varietals that the user can directly navigate to
- The varietal page shows several possible food pairings for the selected varietal and displays recipes of the first listed pairing
- The user can click on any of the pairing suggestions to see recipes based on that keyword

## Setup Instructions

To run the application on a local machine:

- Clone down repository 
- `cd` into repository
- Run ``` npm install ```
- Run ``npm start``
- Webpage will open in seperate browser

## Technologies Used: 
 - React (Hooks, propTypes)
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Cypress
 - Router

## Learning Goals and Project Reflections

### -Learning Goals
- Create an application that solves a problem for a selected audience
- Further develop skills in React, Cypress, and UX/UI

### -Challenges
- I deeply enjoyed adding multiple user flows to the application to fully engage the users of my niche audience
- However, these multiple flows were very time consuming and involved extensive planning and refactoring to maintain organization within the components

### -Wins 
- I am very happy with how engaging this application has become
- The user can simply jump in and see pairings
- The user can click on 8 questions each with several possible answers and uniquely see the results update before their eyes (normally a form like this would have a submit button and only show the results after the button is clicked)
- The user can then select similar varietals
- The user can select other pairings 
- The user can circl back and complete the guide again
- I deeply enjoyed building this multi-pathway, unique app

## Future Additions
- I asked for approval to use Swiper carousel library for the guide and the recipes, however, due to time constraints this additional feature did not make it into the first iteration
- I plan to add this swiper as well as extensive CSS to have the app's styling equal its functionality
